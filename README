Argvark - organise arguments

Initial code commit. Won't run without the database, so example database provided from www.argvark.org.

The code is not ready, it needs a bit of a tidy up. I am committing it earlier than originally planned as I wanted to put it up before starting a new job, something which has happened unexpectedly. :-)

My intention is to finish that tidying, then provide an explanation of what it is all about.
